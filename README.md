# Welcome to Project Starfish!

This hobby project is meant to be a test bed for development of embedded software using continuous integration.

##Goals
1. Create a platform-independent build process (Cmake)
2. Create a structured test suite (unit, integration, acceptance)
3. Create a build & test pipeline
4. Use test-driven development to create software components

##Bonus Goals
* Automate the load procedure
* Create a deployment pipeline
* Create simulation environment
